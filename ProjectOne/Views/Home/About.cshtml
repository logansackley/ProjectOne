<b>Our Mission</b>
<p>We hope to bring together a community of return missionaries and young men and women about to depart on their missions.
    We know through personal experience how intimidating it can be to leave on a mission, and our goal is to limit the amount of stress a missionary
    feels so that he or she can focus on preparing to serve the Lord. That is why we created What's My Mission.com. We hope this will be a place where 
    people can freely contribute and learn about the places they will be serving in. We hope you find this website helps you prepare yourself to 
    becoming a full-time missionary.</p>
